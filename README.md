# Regression_ML_in_END_ICT_C2H4
This is a machine learning study of the quantum dynamical calculations using PACE program suits on ion-cancer therapy (ICT) reaction. C2H4 is the system which is bombarded with a proton projectile.

Packages
Python 3.9.13
scikit-learn 1.0.2 
tensorflow 2.11.0

Folders:
i) Data: All the datasets used for this study is kept in this folder. SMOGN data sets are prepared seperately (in the names SMOGN is used for the SMOGN dataset). 

ii) Models: All the regression models are written in seperate python files as functions.

iii) Models_mull: Contains all the necessary models to predict Mulliken Population.

iv) Plots: All the Plots rerported are kept here, can also be re-generated very easily.

v) Final results: results.py

This python script can generate all the results reported for this study. one should import the particular model is being used, and the dataset. This script has to be kept in the same folders with all the models python scrips. 

vi) krr_results.ipynb : this notebook is to show how to obtain the results for KRR model, as an example.
